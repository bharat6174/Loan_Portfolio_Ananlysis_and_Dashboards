    - Average Debt-to-Income Ration(DTI): Overall
        - Average DTI: MTD

5. **Applications by Month**(Line chart)
6. **Applications by State**(Map)
7. **Applications by Tenor**(Donut Chart)
8. **Applications by Employment Period**(Bar Chart)
9. **Applications by Purpose**(Bar Chart)
10. **Applications by House Ownership**(Tree Map)

## Process
1. Understanding the columns and their significance using data dictionary and data itself.
2. Analysing the data requirement for various KPIs.
3. Then to create metrics and visualisations, creating appropriate pivot tables in a seperate sheet (named as **Design Sheet** in the excel file attached).
4. Making required graphs along with respective pivot tables for various metrics and KPIs.
5. Creating 2 seperate sheets, 1 for each dashboard(named as **Dashboard 1**and **Dashboard 2** in the excel file attached).
6. Making the dashboards and formatting the tiles and charts in the dashboards as per the requirement and visual appeal.
7. At last creating 2 slicers for filtering in the pivot table sheet and attaching the same on dashboards
8. Adding switch tiles on left side of the dashboards for faster switching between both dashboards and the data(loan_data).<br>
**Note:** The interaction with the dashboards and slicers is only possible in the excelsheet, not in the images attached.
